/*The socket will be connected as a client side socket
    and we manage this socket that is just connected in here as well hence why we also have the disconnection in here.
    It is an instance of a socket that we use. 
  On Join
    When the socket reads the string join, it calls a call back function.
    The call back function's parameters is an object with name and room.
    We are access on the backend here for name& room
    Theres a callback in the socket.on event that triggers a response whenver the socket.on event is emmitted
 ERROR HANDELING
    user joined- passes data- do somelogic on backend- pass in a call back that socket.io has gave us 
    if there is an error we handle it with an alert on the front end
MESSAGES
    Admin generated ones are 'message'
    USer generated are 'sendMessage'
